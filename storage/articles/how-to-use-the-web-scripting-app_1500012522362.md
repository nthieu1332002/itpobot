## What is Web Scripting?

Web Scripting is a feature that allows users to automate navigation and form entry on websites without any coding. This tool records user actions, such as entering usernames and passwords, navigating to specific pages, handling pop-ups, running your own JavaScript and more on a website, and then encrypts the recorded script for secure execution on designated devices.

OptiSigns encrypts all the scripts and your password entered with our own private keys.
